Tam asked about why we need to know about reading & writing files for writing
web servers. I brought up the use-case of saving & serving images, videos, etc.

I tried to do this little "20 minute instagram" example, but got stuck in the
weeds of multer / dealing with multipart form parsing in Express.

I'd like to be able to do examples with files; but I also don't want (for the
purpose of examples) for multer to obscure the low-level details of the bits
and bytes moving through the program.

I'd like to revisit this branch sometime and figure out how to make this
example effective.

# Node/Express Boilerplate

This is a template repository for creating simple node / express tutorials and
demos. If you see this, I probably forgot to write the instructions :)
